#Manually Topic Modeling the Panama Papers

##Panama Papers Controversy
The ["Panama Papers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers) were about 12 million leaked documents that shed light upon people around the world who were hiding money in offshore entities through the Panamanian company Mossack Fonseca. The news released in the immediate aftermath of the leak tended to focus on a wide range of issues from the technical aspects of a hack to the implications of various world leaders and celebrities who were exposed. Following the news, I selected 34 articles about the issue and extracted the text content into text folders ([see articles below](#selected-articles).)

##Manual Topic Modeling Activity
Today you'll skim a few articles and try your best to imitate the

Topic Modeling finds words that co-occur within texts at high rates, while taking into consideration the usage of words across the corpus. So, for example, "Panama" will be used at least once in every article (the average is about 6.3 times per article). This means that "Panama" will only be included in an article's keywords if it's used a significant amount of times — certainly more than just 2-3 times.

2. Each person will read two articles about the Panama Papers (see list below for your assigned article)

3. After you’ve read the article, skim back through and write (or type) out words that seem unique to the article. This means words that are used disproportionally more often in your article than in typical language or writing – this can be only once, if you think the word is significantly rare or specific.For example, Panama, used even once or twice, would probably be significant because it’s not a word that people use very often. Remember, you’re only looking at words used, not concepts or themes. You’re imitating a computer algorithm, and algorithms are not particularly smart.
